# Virtual RobotX (VRX)

This is the entry point for teams participating in the current [RobotX Maritime Challenge](http://robotx.org/) or the upcoming Virtual RobotX Challenge (VRX) in 2019.  The repository includes a set of Gazebo simulation elements and examples to support development of RobotX systems.

This is an active development project.  We are adding and improving things all the time.  The project contains a simulation foundation, including an environment similar to the RobotX venue and description of the WAM-V platform.  It is intended as a first step for teams that would then extend the tools for their specific development needs.

## Getting Started

 * The [VRX Wiki](https://bitbucket.org/osrf/vrx/wiki) provides documentation and tutorials.
 * The instructions assume a basic familiarity with the ROS environment and Gazebo.  If these tools are new to you, we recommend starting with the excellent [ROS Tutorials](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials)

## Contributing

The simulation tools under active development to support the RobotX teams.  We are starting simple with the important fundamental aspects of the robot and environment,
but will rely on the community to develop additional functionality around their particular use cases.

If you have any questions about these topics, or would like to work on other aspects, please contribute.  You can contact us directly (see below), submit an [issue](https://bitbucket.org/osrf/vrx/issues) or, better yet, submit a [pull request](https://bitbucket.org/osrf/vrx/pull-requests/)!
